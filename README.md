NukeExplosionEffects is a C++ project that aims to simulate the effects of a nuclear explosion based on different parameters such as bomb power, weather conditions, and population density. The project utilizes various algorithms and formulas to estimate the impact of a nuclear blast on casualties, structural damage, and the need for shelters.
